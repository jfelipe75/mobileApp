## To-Do App (React Native + Expo + TypeScript)
This is a mobile to-do list app built using React Native with Expo and TypeScript. Users can add, complete, and delete tasks, which are stored locally using AsyncStorage. Navigation is handled with Expo Router.

### Project Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
/app/                    - File-based routing using Expo Router
/components/             - (Optional) Reusable UI components (e.g., TaskItem, TaskForm)
/App.tsx or /index.ts    - App entry point

### Prerequisites

Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
